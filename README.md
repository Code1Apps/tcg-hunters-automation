# TCG Hunters Automation

Automation tools for TCG Hunters, including scrapers and automated tasks.

## 🚀 Deployment

The project is automatically deployed via GitHub Actions when a new tag is pushed.

### 1. Nginx Configuration

The image server and automation host are configured via Nginx. See [nginx/README.md](nginx/README.md) for detailed instructions.

### 2. Cron Jobs

To automate the Bulbapedia scraper, you need to load the crontab file on the server.

```bash
# Connect to the server
ssh user@5.39.73.113

# Load the crontab
crontab /var/www/auto.tcghunters.com/crontab

# Verify it's loaded
crontab -l
```

The cron job is set to run every 5 minutes and logs output to `/var/www/auto.tcghunters.com/logs/cron.log`.

### 3. Logs

You can monitor the scraper's execution:

```bash
tail -f /var/www/auto.tcghunters.com/logs/cron.log
```

## 🛠 Features

- **Bulbapedia Scraper**: Automatically fetches new cards from Bulbapedia based on active tasks.
- **Image Serving**: Optimized image serving with Nginx, caching, and CORS support.
- **Automated Deployment**: GitHub Actions workflow for seamless updates.
- **OCR Processing**: CPU-optimized OCR using PaddleOCR to extract text from card images.

## 🔍 OCR Processing

The project includes an OCR script to extract text from images in `public/img/tmp`. It requires Python and PaddleOCR.

### Setup (Virtual Environment)

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the venv (Windows)
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# Activate the venv (Linux/Server)
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

```bash
# Activate venv first if not already active
# Run OCR on the default folder
python src/ocr_cpu.py

# Run OCR on a custom folder
python src/ocr_cpu.py --folder public/img/some_other_folder
```

This will create a `.json` file for each image containing the extracted text, ordered from top-left to bottom-right.
